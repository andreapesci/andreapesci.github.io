            "content": "This fire system simulates realistic fire spread and interaction in a game environment. Fires are triggered at specific locations, complete with visual and audio effects. The fire spreads dynamically based on random chances and timers, creating an unpredictable, realistic behavior. It interacts with various game objects, like characters and trees , applying damage and following natural contours, such as climbing up trees or spreading along branches (handled with splines to make the fire experience more realistic). The system includes sound effects for ignition, spreading, and extinguishing fires, adding to the immersive experience. This dynamic simulation creates a challenging and evolving element in the game, enhancing player engagement.",
