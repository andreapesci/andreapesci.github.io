    "brieflyMe": "Hi! I'm Andrea, a game programmer from Italy, passionate about games since I was 5. I started learning game development with Unreal Engine in late 2023, and over the past year, I've been working to turn this passion into my daily job. Previously, after earning a degree in Computer Science from the University of Milan, I worked as a software developer for many years. <br><br>Here, you can see some of the projects I've worked on during this period. I always strive to polish my work to achieve the best possible results, and I'm never afraid to take on new challenges or learn new things. <br><br>If you've read this far, I would love to get in touch with you, so feel free to contact me in any way you prefer! And as always, keep gaming!",
