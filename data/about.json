    "brieflyMe": "Hi! I'm Andrea, a game programmer from Milan, Italy, passionate about games since I was 5. I started learning Unreal Engine in late 2023, after using Godot and GDScript for a while.<br>Previously, after earning a degree in Computer Science, I worked as a software developer for many years, during which I had the chance to refine my skills in C++, C#, and Python. Soon after, I became a Project Lead Developer, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with different teams in an Agile environment. This experience allowed me to learn various Scrum software and practices.<br><br>Here, you can see some of the projects I've worked on during this period. I always strive to polish my work to achieve the best possible results, and I'm never afraid to take on new challenges or learn new things.<br><br>If you've read this far, I would love to get in touch with you, so feel free to contact me in any way you prefer! And as always, keep gaming!",
